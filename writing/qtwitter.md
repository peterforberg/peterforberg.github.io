#### The QAnon Twitter Network

*This work is part of a forthcoming research paper. Please do not distribute or share.* 

As part of my cyberethnographic investigation of the online conspiracy theory QAnon, I collected roughly 400,000 tweets from QAnons based on popular hashtags, such as #WWG1WGA (Where We Go One, We Go All) and #DigitalSoldier. The tweets accompanying these hashtags were interesting in their own right, but the user bios of the people posting the tweets were much more telling of the community online. 

First, some trends from the tweets themselves.

The single most used term in all tweets was former US president Donald Trump's username, @realdonaldtrump.

The trends found in the content of the tweets were unsurprising: QAnons regularly tweeted at Donald Trump, requesting assistance with their plans to #SaveTheChildren or start a new Great Awakening that would bring about widespread social change. However, the simple invocation of Trump's username tells us a great deal about QAnons. Known as the Twitter president, QAnons' access to Trump made them feel like they were close to power and change. As one of my interviewees put it, "Q makes me feel like I am in the Oval Office with the president."

More interesting were the Twitter users' bios. This graph shows the most popular terms in users' bios:

Here, we see some expected results again. We have Christians, veterans, supporters of the second amendment, and conservatives. However, we also see the terms "wife," "mom," "mother," and "father" in the top 30. This points to the underlying maternalism of the movement, which activated the rage of mothers worried about child trafficking. A more complex picture of QAnon, one that I heard in my interviews, emerges: Not all members were Trump-obsessed or die hard conservatives. They were genuinely concerned about child trafficking and drew from the hardships they had faced as young women.

To further investigate this, I manually coded the 500 most popular identifiers in bios. I placed them into 8 discrete categories, except for "maternity," which I allowed to overlap with "domesticity and family" in order to show the prevalence of mothers.

Notably absent from the "conservativism" category is party affiliation: most QAnons identified as libertarians or independents before Republicans. This points to how well Trump and Q were able to motiviate apathetic voters who had little interest in the traditional 2-party system. This final graph shows us how frequently words occurred next to each other, basically showing how likely any two given words were to be in the same bio. This demonstrates how QAnons carved out their own factions. Each faction eventually led back to Trump, but they had divergent groups, with some more focused on militarism and others more focused on spirituality.

I took one of my research subjects, a deeply spiritual person, and tried to delineate how she might experience Twitter based on her relationship to other groups. Essentially, she herself was limited to a fairly spiritual background, but in her broader social network, she was put in contact with the more militaristic and financial components of the QAnon theory. What's important to recognize here is that large networks graph or bar charts of the experiences of hundreds of thousands of people are not representative of the experiences of individual people, that within each network there is a person experiencing it.
