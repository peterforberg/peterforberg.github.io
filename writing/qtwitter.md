#### The QAnon Twitter Network

*This work is part of a forthcoming research paper. Please do not distribute or share.* 

As part of my cyberethnographic investigation of the online conspiracy theory QAnon, I collected roughly 500,000 tweets from QAnons based on popular hashtags, such as #WWG1WGA (Where We Go One, We Go All) and #DigitalSoldier. The tweets accompanying these hashtags were interesting in their own right, but the user bios of the people posting the tweets were much more telling of the community online. 

First, some trends from the tweets themselves.

The single most used term in all tweets was former US president Donald Trump's username, @realdonaldtrump.
