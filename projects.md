### projects

Some of projects are big, some are small. Some are good, some are bad. All of them are fun. For me.

**\#** My presentation on [algorithmic ethnography](https://spark.adobe.com/page/cRH1UENjuWLAS/) represents the most public-facing example of my advocacy for new and rigirous forms of online investigation and ethnography in both journalism and anthropology. While this method of inquiry is being fleshed out in forthcoming papers, the linked presentation gives a simple, stratighforward overview of the merits of algorthimically-sensitive cyberethnographic investigations.

**\#** *[Mother of 1000s](https://mother1000s.peterforberg.com)* was a simple HTML game run as part of a larger ARG. The (now-archived) game presented players with a small [kalanchoe daigremontiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalanchoe_daigremontiana) to take care of using four basic commands: snip, water, light, ignore. As the world outside the plant's window changed, players had to choose between these limited options to address issues beyond the scope of plant care. As a collectively played game, players were given a timeframe in which to make a decision, and by clicking their desired command, each individual player "voted" for the final outcome. The game's narrative addresses the limitations imposed on individuals to effect real change in global environmental issues.

**\#** *[Eco-clicker](https://eco-clicker.peterforberg.com)* is a simple Javascript game designed in a day. Unlike most clicker games, which incentivize resource maximimzation and furious clicking, *Eco-clicker* puts limits on the user's capacity for automation, and it attempts to quantify the unintended side effects of a economic approach to environmental resource management.

**\#** While I like to read and write traditional, human-written poetry, I also enjoy the quirks of poetry imagined by machines. This simple [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qUE27J2VIthnXfBCxStaENDxnBpGLMQ4Mnqiwi_GoLg/copy) lets users input text into one column and then sends the poems through a crucible of Google translations, resulting in some funky rhymes and rhythms. I carefully curated the order of languages and choice of languages; otherwise, the text becomes illegible or completely broken, so have fun with it! I used this same method to completely destroy horoscopes in [@wostarastrology](https://twitter.com/wostarastrology) on Twitter. After collecting thousands of horoscopes, I fed them to a GPT-2 text generator. Then, I had that generator produce thousands of new horoscopes, and then I fed those horoscopes into that Google sheet. The Twitter bot sends out these magnificents drops of bizarre wisdom and anxieties every 6 hours.
