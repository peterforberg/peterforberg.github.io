Hello. My name is Peter Forberg. I am a jointly-enrolled undergraduate/graduate student at the University of Chicago pursuing a bachelor's degree in sociology and a master's degree in the [digital studies of language, culture, and history](http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/jointdegreedigs/ "in case you're wondering what the heck that is").

Academically, I have an interest in political media, journalism, censorship, children's media, LGBTQ health, ethnography, video games, conspiracy theories, and internet culture generally. I've worked as a game designer, developed research studies, and collected internships like an entomologist collects butterflies.

Personally, I enjoy poetry, co-op videogames, tabletop RPGs, cooking, not spending copious amounts of time on Twitter or TikTok, and being in nature. During my free time in college, I edited [Sliced Bread Literary Magazine](https://slicedbreadmag.com/) and occasionally did some acting. I'm also a Chicago native, so I spent quite a bit of time [showing people around](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1i1fDGnCdE924_6PQjSPl2Crw0VIxDsM-&usp=sharing "this links to a map of places i like to go please don't look for me there"). For a couple years, I even helped make movies about [gender](https://vimeo.com/245565745), politics, and the meaning of life, but that takes too much time.
