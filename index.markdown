My name is Peter Forberg. I am a jointly-enrolled undergraduate/graduate student at the University of Chicago pursuing a bachelor's degree in sociology and a master's degree in the digital studies of language, culture, and history. Between the two, I have a lot on my plate.

Academically, I have an interest in political media, journalism, censorship, children's media, LGBTQ health, ethnography, video games, conspiracy theories, and Internet culture generally. 

Personally, I enjoy poetry, co-op videogames, tabletop RPGs, cooking, not spending copious amounts of time on Twitter or TikTok, and being in nature.
