### miscellaneous projects

Here are some things that I've made.

**\#** This website.

**\#** An [early, interactive version](https://qquiz.peterforberg.com) of my BA thesis on QAnon.

**\#** An HTML and Javascript-driven [network visualization tool](https://loss.peterforberg.com) made as part of my MA thesis.

**\#** An [interactive demonstration](https://express.adobe.com/page/cRH1UENjuWLAS/){:target="_blank"} of my early digital ethnographic approach to QAnon.

**\#** An [audience-controlled HTML game](https://mother1000s.peterforberg.com){:target="_blank"} run as part of a larger climate change ARG, now archived.

**\#** A [clicker-style HTML game](https://eco-clicker.peterforberg.com){:target="_blank"} designed in one day for a climate change ARG.

**\#** An [AI-powered horoscope bot](https://twitter.com/wostarastrology){:target="_blank"} crudely translated in and out of multiple languages in a form akin to this [Google sheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qUE27J2VIthnXfBCxStaENDxnBpGLMQ4Mnqiwi_GoLg/copy){:target="_blank"}

**\#** OK, not an archivable project, but I once used GIS to get myself out of a parking ticket. Not an easy thing to do in Chicago.
