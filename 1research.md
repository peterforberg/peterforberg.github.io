<!-- **Technology and Social Change**   
While researching public health and higher education at the University of Chicago, I studied how [video games](https://ci3.uchicago.edu/new-homepage-working/labs/game-changer-chicago/) and [alternate reality games](https://fourcastlab.com/) could be leveraged to educate, socialize, and motivate youth as they navigated difficult topics such as sexual health and climate change. I continued studying the political implications of technology in my work on political movements, taking to online video games and social media platforms in order to understand how new media could become the staging ground for political activism, identity formation, and organization. -->
